Silence needs to be played in the destination icecast server, so that
machines listening to your show don't just give up on playback when
attempting to access the stream while nothing's playing, or fail to
play if the show broadcast needs to be restarted.

This silence needs to be piped into an icecast overlay stream.  This
direc tory contains the necessary Upstart configuration files and
shell scripts that will pipe the silence into the icecast server, as
well as an icecast configuration file that can be used as an example.

Enjoy!
